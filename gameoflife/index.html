                <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> is a simulation made
                up of cells that can be either dead or alive.
                The simulation has very simple rules: if a cell is dead, and has exactly 3 alive neighbours,
                it will be alive the next timestep. A cell with fewer than 2 or more than 3 alive neighbours
                will die. Otherwise a cell stays the same. The fascination of the Game of Life is that from
                such simple rules on an individual cell level spawns incredibly complex behaviour on a macro
                scale - in fact, the Game of Life is

                <h2>How to play?</h2>
                <p>
                This implementation has two panels, with buttons in the middle of them. The upper panel shows the
                game itself, as the simulation plays out. The "play" and "pause" buttons start and stop the simulation.
                The "load" button loads the board to the simulation. This board can be inputted into the lower panels
                text input. Zeroes represent dead cells and ones represent alive cells. The "delay" slider controls
                the delay between each timestep, so in practice the speed of the simulation.
